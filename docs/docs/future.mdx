# daisyUI 5 and Tailwind 4

as of 2025-02-03 daisyUI 5 is not yet released 
and does in fact include a [calendar / datepicker component](https://v5.daisyui.com/components/calendar/). 
It however used 3rd party libraries like pikaday and react-day-picker

we use only dayjs and have some highly opionated ideas on solving date and time pickers.

we will release a major version when daisyUI 5 and Tailwind 4 is released and stable (plugins are a problem at the moment).
